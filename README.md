This is the legacy version of Fusebox; I have no plans to update, change, or finish this project.
I have no use for it anymore, other than to boast about how this project taught me a lot about scripting on Roblox and optimizing your code. As for structure and organization, however, Fusebox is a game developer's hell. It's
degrading to talk about a passion project like this, but it's the truth and it needs to be said, especially since I had plans to commercialize this. It's a type-inferred hellscape, the root-driven directory structure is unconventional, and everything knows too
much about each other and it's very tightly coupled. One can just reference the root of the directory and delete it. Boom, the entire game's logic is gone, easy as that. Anyways, enough about that. This is about all I can provide to this project. It works, and
has minimal bugs, so there's that! I will admit, it's still fun to mess around with and write commands. Values are type inferred, there's saving and loading, utility commands, file path autocomplete, seamless and bugless map changing,
and key binding.

Documentation for using Fusebox is here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Nxry-ZJJnJLYVU9Ag3DLK_o_A5Erv7Iao9iRcl1qcA/edit?usp=sharing

I dumped all the scripts into the repository. If you want the functioning framework, it's in the Roblox page: https://www.roblox.com/games/6272168771/Fusebox-Legacy

I do have plans to develop a new Fusebox, which is going to be a debug tool instead of a rigid framework, much like cm;dr, that developers can integrate into their game and make use of the command-line and even some modular GUI. Not yet, but soon.
