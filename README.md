I open-sourced Fusebox. I have no use for it anymore, other than to boast about how this project taught me a lot about scripting on Roblox and optimizing your code. Emphasis on optimizing - as for organization, however, Fusebox is a game developer's hell. It's
degrading to talk about a passion project like this, but it's the truth and it needs to be said, especially since I had plans to commercialize this. It's a type-inferred hellscape, the root-driven directory structure is unconventional, and everything knows too
much about each other and it's very tightly coupled. One can just reference the root of the directory and delete it. Boom, the entire game's logic is gone, easy as that. Anyways, enough about that. This is about all I can provide to this project. It works, and
has minimal bugs, so there's that! I will admit, it's still fun to mess around with and write commands. Just remember that variables are dynamically typed, there's saving and loading, utility commands, file path autocomplete, seamless and bugless map changing,
and key binding. The kind of stuff that's hard to find on a platform like Roblox. Documentation for using Fusebox is here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Nxry-ZJJnJLYVU9Ag3DLK_o_A5Erv7Iao9iRcl1qcA/edit?usp=sharing

I do have plans to develop a new Fusebox, which is going to be a debug tool instead of a rigid framework, much like cm;dr, that developers can integrate into their game and make use of the command-line and even some modular GUI. Not yet, but soon.

It's been a fucking while but I'm back. I can't entirely recall what I've done with Fusebox since the last entry. I think I was at a point where I was 95% done with Fusebox, and I just got bored with it right there. I realized at that point that the entire framework
I've built was a confusing mess. The command line didn't center around the framework, but instead the framework centered around the command line. Does that make sense? In other words, the framework I developed only focused on the fruitfulness of the command line,
which would leave the actual game itself to be a confusing mess because the focus of development wasn't put on that.
