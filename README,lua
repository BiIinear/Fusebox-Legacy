-- SETUP

-- 1. Move 'Fusebox' to ServerScriptService

-- 2. Move 'HideGameStartup' to ReplicatedFirst

-- 3. Disable 'CharacterAutoLoads' in Players

-- 4. There should be nothing inside the Workspace, otherwise it will interfere with the map loading.

-- NOTE: It's intended to use Fusebox on an empty place. If you want to make a new game using Fusebox, you should
-- start out on an empty new place. Likewise, if you're trying to add Fusebox into your already developed game, you
-- should properly integrate it onto Fusebox.
